        Suppose you made choices like above, and the computer draws 35. Then you will pay 35 ECUs,
        and keep 100-35=65 ECUs for that round. We will then tell you the value of Q. Suppose the computer
        draws 60. Then you will keep your 100 ECUs, and we wonâ€™t tell you the value of Q.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the computer draws 65. Then you can keep 100 ECUs for that round. We will not tell you the value of Q in
        that round
