   Now the following two cases are equally likely. And Red Urn and Black Urn are equally likely.
</p>
<br>
    The following might be the balls drawn by the computer:
    <br>
    <img src= "{% static "intro_part/Urn_balls.png" %}" height="300">
</p>
<p>
    <br>
    12 red balls and 8 black balls are drawn.
</p>
<div id="ex_free_Q">
    <p>{% formfield player.free_Q %}</p>
</div>
<div id="quiz">
    <p>
        If you choose yes in the above question, you will be asked the following question:
        For each row, please indicate whether you would know the value of Q at that price.
        <br>
        <img src="{% static "intro_part/Urn_QQuiz_Ans.png" %}" height="300">
    </p>
    <p>
        Suppose you made choices like above, and the computer draws 35. Then you will pay 35 ECUs,
        and keep 100-35=65 ECUs for that round. We will then tell you the value of Q. Suppose the computer
        draws 60. Then you will keep your 100 ECUs, and we wonâ€™t tell you the value of Q.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the computer draws 65. Then you can keep 100 ECUs for that round. We will not tell you the value of Q in
        that round
    </p>
</div>
<p>
    Next we will ask you to guess the color of the urn.
