   The whole experiment contains 100 rounds. In the beginning of each 10 rounds, we will show you a table with information
    that applies to the following 10 rounds.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    This table means in Rounds 1-10, the probability of Q=0.8 is 50%, and the probability of Q=0.6 is 50%. In other words,
    they are equally likely. In addition, the probability of Red Urn is 50%, and the probability of Black Urn is 50%.
