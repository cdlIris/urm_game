   The whole experiment contains 40 rounds, equally divided into 4 Blocks. In the beginning of each Block, we will show you a table with information that applies to the following 10-round Block.

<p>
The table below means in Rounds 1-10, the probability of Q=0.7 is 50%, and the probability of Q=0.6 is 50%. In other words, they are equally likely. In addition, the probability of Red Urn is 75%, and the probability of Black Urn is 25%.
