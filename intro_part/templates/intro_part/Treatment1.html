    In the beginning of each round, you will be given an endowment of 100 ECUs. Any gain or loss from that round will be
    added to this amount. The amount remaining at the end of the round will not be carried over to the following round.
    At the end of the experiment 1 round will be randomly selected. Your ending balance in the selected round will
    determine your final payment.

    We have two urns: a Red Urn and a Black Urn. Each urn contains 10 balls, with a mix of red balls and black balls.
    The proportion of red balls in the Red Urn and the proportion of black balls in the Black Urn are always equal to Q,
    which is greater than 50%. That means, there are always more red balls in the Red Urn and more black balls in the
    Black Urn. The exact value of Q varies from one round to another. In each round, you wonâ€™t know the exact value of Q,
    but may have the chance to learn as the round proceeds.
